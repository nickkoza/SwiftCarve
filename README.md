# SwiftCarve - Arm-Mounted Saw Prop
I developed this arm-mounted circular saw as part of a mad doctor costume for Halloween 2017. Along with the spinning foam blade it also features a smoking effect, lights, and sound. It's all coordinated by an Arduino Nano mounted in a custom PCB. The smoke effect is provided via a modified vape pen.

This code is for the Arduino Nano that's mounted on the custom PCB that coordinates the various parts of the prop.
