# SwiftCarve - Arm-Mounted Saw Prop

SwiftCarve is an arm-mounted circular saw prop that I designed for a Halloween costume. This code is for the Arduino Nano that's mounted on the custom PCB that coordinates the various aspects of the prop.

Features:
* Spinning (soft) blade
* Fog effect
* Lighting
* Audio
